## Assumptions

1. `Make transfer form validation` - Best practice is to manage validation inside template with desiable submit button and if I submit form without any changes in provided fields, so according to reactive form it is not dirty form and it will not showing any validation error message, but in our case I do not make any changes in the provided submit button component that's why all validations moved from template to ts. 
2. `Frontend Technical Assignment` - There is a difference in expected output and provided component because it was mentioned not to modify existing components hence this differnce prevails.  
3. `Transactions List Data` - TransactionService first tries to get the data from API if it fails to get data in any scenario from the API local json file is picked up.
